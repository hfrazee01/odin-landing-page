Practice new Flexbox skills is HTML and CSS by trying to mimic a landing page design provided by Odin!

With this project, the goal is to illustrate my understanding of using Flexbox instead of using the traditional box model.

Since the image of the landing page was tall and skinny, the landing page was designed with the intent that the browser window only filled half of a user's screen. The hope was to get the landing page to look as similar to the full-design.png file located in the images folder. Most colors and fonts for this page come from the colors_and_fonts.png file from the images folder.

This project demonstrates my knowledge of Flexbox, my knowledge on the difference between align-items and justify-content in CSS, and my current ability to place containers and items in HTML effectively.
